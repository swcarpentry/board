Governance
==========

1.  <a name="foundation"></a> 
    The Software Carpentry Foundation has four components: the
    Membership, the Steering Committee, the Advisory Council, and the
    Executive Director.

2.  <a name="membership"></a>
    The Membership is made up of:

    a.  Every qualified instructor who has taught at least twice in the
        past two calendar years (730 days prior to the announced election date).

    b.  Anyone who has done 30 days or more work for the SCF in the past
        calendar year.

    c.  Anyone who has, in the opinion of the Steering Committee, made
        a significant contribution in the past year.

    Members elect the Steering Committee, and may also seek election to
    it.

3.  <a name="steering-committee-roles"></a>
    The Steering Committee makes all significant strategic and
    financial decisions for the Foundation.  Its members are also
    expected to take on other responsibilities as needed.

    a.  The Steering Committee must meet at least monthly, either in person or
        online.

    b.  Minutes of the Steering Committee's meetings must be published
        within one week of each meeting.

4.  <a name="steering-committee-elections"></a>
    The Steering Committee is re-elected annually.

    a.  Every SCF member, and every organization (through a single designated representative voter) that qualifies as a
        Partner or Affiliate under the organizational membership
        rules, gets one vote in the annual election, the date of which
        is announced at least 90 days in advance.

    b.  Every SCF member may stand for election by announcing their
        candidacy at least 30 days in advance of it.

    c.  The seven people who receive the most votes form the new
        Steering Committee.

    d.  No organization may have more than two representatives on the
        Steering Committee.  If more than two people who are
        affiliated with an organization are elected, they must step
        down one by one to be replaced by other candidates in order of
        the number of votes received.

5.  <a name="advisory-council">
    The Advisory Council is made up of representatives of organizations
    that support the Software Carpentry Foundation's mission.  The
    Steering Committee must consult with it when making significant
    strategic, contractual, or financial decisions.

    a.  The Advisory Council meets as determined by the chair, either in person or online.

    b.  Minutes of the Advisory Council's meetings must be published
        within one week of each meeting.

    c.  Any organization that qualifies as a Partner at the 'Silver' level may appoint a representative to the Advisory Council.

    d.  The Steering Committee may decide to co-opt additional
        persons to the Advisory Council from the wider community at
        any time, with a default term of one year. The number of
        co-opted members shall not exceed the number of partners and
        affiliates represented on the Advisory Council. Co-option
        shall be done by majority vote of the Steering Committee.

5.  <a name="executive-director">
    The Executive Director is appointed by, and answers to, the
    Steering Committee.  He or she is a paid employee of the
    Foundation, and is responsible for overseeing its day-to-day
    operations.

    a.  The Executive Director may not be a member of either the
        Steering Committee or the Advisory Council.

    b.  He or she may attend meetings of the Steering Committee and
        the Advisory Council when invited to do so.

    For a complete description of the Executive Director's role, see
    the most recent version of the job description written and approved
    by the Steering Committee.

7.  <a name="numfocus">
    The Foundation's legal, financial, and contractual affairs are
    handled through NumFOCUS, with which the Foundation has a Fiscal
    Sponsorship Agreement (FSA).  The project lead and two Steering
    Committee members are signatories of the FSA.

    a.  On behalf of the Foundation, NumFOCUS holds the copyright on
        all Software Carpentry materials and is the owner of its
        trademarks and other intellectual property.

    b.  Money received by NumFOCUS on behalf of the Foundation is used
        to pay for core staff (such as the Executive Director), for
        special events (such as instructor travel costs for workshops
        in developing countries), and for incidental expenses (such as
        website hosting).

    c.  NumFOCUS must present a monthly financial statement to the SCF
        Steering Committee.

    d.  All expenditures except those covered by Rule 7e below must be
        approved in advance by the Steering Committee, or by a
        sub-committee appointed by it.

    e.  The Executive Director may spend up to US$2000 per month on
        items whose individual cost is no greater than US$500 each
        without the prior approval of the Steering Committee, but must
        report all such expenditures to the Steering Committee in the
        month in which they occur.

8.  <a name="staff"></a>
    The work of the Software Carpentry Foundation is done by core
    staff (those employed or contracted directly by the SCF), by staff
    working for Partners, Affiliates, and Sponsors (jointly referred
    to as "member organizations"), and by volunteers.

    a.  Staff employed or contracted by NumFOCUS on behalf of the
        Software Carpenry Foundation are primarily responsible for
        coordinating curriculum development, training instructors,
        outreach, coordinating fundraising, and other stewardship
        activities.

    b.  Member organization staff are primarily responsible for
        activities such as arranging (and sometimes delivering)
        workshops.

    c.  The SCF and member organizations will establish clear points
        of contact for people and organizations who desire training or
        have other inquiries.

    d.  All requests for Software Carpentry training must be shared
        promptly with core staff and member organization
        representatives, and summarized monthly to the Steering
        Committee.

    e.  Responsibility for arranging workshops will be allocated
        geographically, or as otherwise directed by the Steering
        Committee in consultation with the Advisory Council and member
        organizations.

    f.  No person or organization may offer Software Carpentry branded
        certification without prior approval from the Steering
        Committee.

9.  <a name="fundraising">
    The Software Carpentry Foundation raises and spends money in
    support of the goals listed in its mission statement.

    a.  People and organizations may donate money directly to the SCF
        (via NumFOCUS) to be spent at the Steering Committee's
        discretion.

    b.  Donations earmarked for particular purposes (e.g., to sponsor
        a particular workshop) must be approved by the Steering
        Committee or its appointed sub-committee before being
        accepted.

    c.  The SCF may accept workshop registration fees, lump sum
        donations, and other contributions in exchange for helping to
        arrange workshops, create new curriculum, etc.  All such
        arrangements must be approved in advance by the Steering
        Committee, or by a sub-committee appointed by it.

    d.  Member organizations may accept donations, workshop
        registration fees, grants, and other contributions toward
        Software Carpentry activities.  All such arrangements for
        Software Carpentry branded activities must be approved in
        advance by the Steering Committee, and money raised in this
        way must be reported quarterly to the Steering Committee.
   
    e.  Foundation staff may not approach a grant agency or other
        organization for amounts in excess of US$5000 without first
        getting clearance from the Steering Committee.

    f.  Member organizations are encouraged to share information about
        funding opportunities with the Steering Committee, and must
        get prior clearance from the Steering Committee or its
        appointed sub-committee for proposals that include support for
        Software Carpentry activities greater than US$5000.

    g.  Foundation staff may not enter into private financial
        arrangements for Software Carpentry related activities without
        prior approval from the Steering Committee.

10. <a name="rules-of-order"></a>
    The rules contained in [Robert's Rules of Order Revised
    (1921)][RRoO] shall govern the Foundation in all cases to which
    they are applicable, and in which they are not inconsistent with
    the by-laws or the special rules of this Foundation.

11. <a name="amendment"></a>
    The Steering Committee may amend these rules at any time by
    majority vote, and must re-approve these rules or an amended
    version of them every two years, beginning one year after its
    initial formation.

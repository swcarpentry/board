### Communication

*   Communication
   *    GitHub
        *   Pros
            *   vc
            *   plain-text
            *   everything else in SCF is stored this way
        *   Cons
   *    Etherpad
        *   Pros
        *   Cons
   *    BlueJeans
        *   Pros
        *   Cons
   *    Slack
        *   Pros
            *   emoji
        *   Cons
   *    Lucid Meetings
        *   JW: I would like to try Lucid Meetings (I'm willing to pay for our 1st month)
        *   Pros:
            *   has dynamic voting, has some meeting notes, has a native scheduling app
            *   relies on skype 
            *   can export notes as markdown
            *   would replace etherpad?
        *   Cons:
            *   $50/month
   *    email - the vinyl of the web
   *    If we have to ditch EtherPad -> Google Docs
        *   Pros
        *   Cons
*   Organization, documentation, and transparency
    *   Confluence wiki (free for open-source projects) - yes but apparently it has to be actual software development project (we tried to get this for ELIXIR UK and apparently we don't qualify - Aleksandra)
    *   Trello board (or http://kanboard.net/, AGPL)
    *   GitHub

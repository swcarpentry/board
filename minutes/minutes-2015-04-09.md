## Welcome 

Meeting began with a spontanious discussion regarding how to advertise for workshops, so that we can pull in more requests for workshops. Focus was on conferences and other related arenas. We will explore ads with for instance:

* GVW: Explore ads with SIAM (Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics)

* Possibly speak with somebody at American Nuclear Society (ANS), one possibility according to Katy could be Rachel Slaybaugh (who's also at UC Berkeley, and is heavily involved with ANS activities).

* Anyone know someone at APS (American Physical Society)?

* Karin and Aleksandra: do something for ISMB? 

## Previous Action Items [ 10 min, until 0:15 ]

Self Sufficient Workshop PR: no update

Discussion Listhost Email About Commercial Workshop Pilot: done

Set up In-Person meeting: working on it, potentially re-scheduled for end of June.

Introduce confidential email address and process [confidential@software-carpentry.org](mailto:confidential@software-carpentry.org): ongoing

Mentorship committee will discuss new name: no update

## Updates from Subcommittees [ 10 min, until 0:25 ]

**Fees:** There has been another iteration of the document describing these things. We are probably almost there, but we want to discuss it with Josh Greenberg (Sloan).

**Finance:** Have drafted a financial report which will be made publicly available once the information has been firmed up. At the moment there are lots of uncertainties, because we are lacking info from NUMFocus. Balance at the moment seems to be around 45k. Our income is mostly from memberships and some from workshops. Our expenses are mostly Greg's salary. We have not been billed by NUMFocus yet. We have less income that we thought, but also less expenses. We still have fewer paid workshops than what we need to keep the lights on (target number here is 8 per month). Observation: we not coming close to the balance we wanted between teacher training, membership fees and workshop fees. No teacher training income this quarter. 

No significant update from the other subcomittees beyond what is in the agenda. 

## MSL Relationship Update [20 min, until 0:45]

Background: We have had issues with the way communications and public relations are handled by MSL. Katy and Matt have addressed this with them.

Motion: Express concerns to MSL about their public representation of SWC-MSL history and relationship. Offer a 3-month trial period MOU if they are amenable.
Motion PASSED.

## Instructor Training [ 10 min, until 0:55 ]

**Trainee selection:** The main question is how do we select who should be admitted to our teacher training program. We do have people applying who have not been either learners or helpers. Should we require that all applicants should have been through a workshop, with potential for waivers of requirement in special circumstances?

Motion: Trainees have to have been though a workshop, with potential for waivers of requirement. Passed

Addition: waivers will be managed by mentoring committee. Most important for waivers is non-availability to workshops. Also consider people who are established teachers. 

**Online instructor training:** Greg would like to experiment more with instructor training online. Additionally, can we charge a small sum for two-days of training?
In connection with this, can we collaborate with CWSEI on training, all are scientists who have become teachers. A collaboration with CWSEI would for instance allow us to filter out people who just want the training, but who do not want to teach for us. This will also help us build a partnership with them, SWC instructors are potential hires for them. Greg will talk with CWSEI this afternoon. Further on we would need to figure out how to do these things in practice. 

Action: Greg will give us a written proposal on how this could work. 


## Fee Structure [5 min, until 1:00]

The discussion is whether we should as our Advisory Council of whether we can keep all of the money collected from fees for workshops. All our current partners send all of the money to us anyhow. A major consideration is that we have to ensure that we don’t change the rules on people, to avoid confusion etc.

Action: Aleksandra ask AC if this is ok. 

## Advisory Council [10 min, until 1:10]

Action: Greg will put up an email list.   
Action: Greg liaise with Jonah Duckles to get him to contact AC and get an online meeting up and running. Note: give them lots of lead-time.   
Action: Katy/Greg will ensure that the membership.csv file is updated.   
Action: Use Aleksandras email when contacting new members.

## Issues in the board repo [ 5 min, until 1:15]

None.

## Adjourn

DONE!

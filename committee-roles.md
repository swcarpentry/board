### Pathways for Communication

General guidelines for handling issues through the Software Carpentry 
Foundation Steering Committee can be found in the [issue escalation 
guidelines](https://github.com/swcarpentry/board/blob/master/issue-escalation.md). 
In addition to that, general resources and pathways for communication vary 
based on the participants.

The key pathways for communication among the SCF Steering Committee include:

* Regular meetings by phone, scheduled by the Committee Chair
* An email listhost for discussions and voting
* Public and private GitHub repositories for document sharing

The key pathways for communication between the SCF Committee members and the Advisory Council include:

* Occasional meetings combining both the Steering Committee and Advisory Council by phone or in person
* A shared mailing list for inter-body communication
* Public and Private GitHub repositories for document sharing
* Indirect communication through the Executive Director

The key pathways for communication to sponsors and stakeholders include:

* Indirect communication through the Executive Director and Coordinator staff members
* Individual, existing relationships with those stakeholders

The key pathways for communication with learners, instructors, and contributors include:

* The Coordinator staff member
* Public Software Carpentry repositories on GitHub
* Public Software Carpentry mailing lists (i.e. Discuss)


### Methods of Participation

Participation must include 3 hours per week of Software Carpentry Foundation 
volunteer time. This minimum total volunteer time includes time spent in 
Steering Committee meetings.

Participation may involve any of a number of activities that serve the Software 
Carpentry Foundation. 

- serving on subcommittees which serve the activities of the Steering Committee.
- supporting initiatives prioritized by the Steering Committee and the Executive Director
- organizing and overseeing evaluation and assessment
- organizing and overseeing mentorship activities
- fund-raising, writing grant proposals, forming collaborations, encouraging 
  community members to write grant proposals, etc.
- writing blog posts, emails, and other updates to communicate Committee 
  activities with the community
- and much more...

While continuing to be an instructor for workshops is welcomed, that work is 
independent of the participation requirements and does not count toward the 
requirement of 3 volunteer hours per week.

### Elements of Dedication

Dedication to the Software Carpentry Foundation relies heavily on familiarity 
with the policies and guidelines agreed upon by the community and by the 
Committee. Most importantly, Committee members must be familiar with and 
supportive of both the [Software Carpentry Foundation 
mission](https://github.com/swcarpentry/board/blob/master/mission-statement.md) 
and the [Software Carpentry Code of 
Conduct.](http://software-carpentry.org/conduct.html)

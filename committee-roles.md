## Responsibilities

[communication](#communication) with other members of the committee as well as 
members of the Software Carpentry community.  Additionally, since this is an 
activist Committee, its members are responsible for volunteering time toward 
their own active [participation](#participation) in the Software Carpentry 
community.  Finally, Committee members must be [dedicated](#dedication) to 
Software Carpentry and the SCF as a whole. In particular, they:

* <a name="communication"></a> Will Communicate

guidelines](https://github.com/swcarpentry/board/blob/master/issue-escalation.md). 
In addition to that, general resources and pathways for communication vary 
based on the participants.

<a name="participation-methods">
### Methods of Participation

All steering committees have meetings, but Software Carpentry's
activist committee must also engage in the wider Software Carpentry
effort.  This helps advance assorted Software Carpentry projects and
efforts, while also keeping committee members in touch with the wider
Software Carpentry community.  The minimum [3 volunteer hours per
week](#participation) may involve any of a number of activities that
serve Software Carpentry.

- serving on the committee (time in meetings, preparation for
  meetings, and communicating committee activities with the
  community).
- organizing, instructing, or otherwise contributing to particular
  events or workshops.
- organizing and overseeing evaluation and assessment
- organizing and overseeing mentorship activities
- managing or contributing to lesson development (or template
  development or other Software Carpentry tooling).
- fund-raising, writing grant proposals, forming collaborations,
  encouraging community members to write grant proposals, etc.
- and much more...

As committee members, your committee responsibilities come first, so
you shouldn't skip meetings or avoid posting meeting minutes because
you've already put in three hours of workshop instruciton in a given
week.  You should also try and spend your three hours each week; a
period of intense work doesn't excuse two months of silence.

### Elements of Dedication

Dedication to the Software Carpentry Foundation relies heavily on familiarity 
with the policies and guidelines agreed upon by the community and by the 
Committee. Most importantly, Committee members must be familiar with and 
supportive of both the [Software Carpentry Foundation 
mission](https://github.com/swcarpentry/board/blob/master/mission-statement.md) 
and the [Software Carpentry Code of 
Conduct.](http://software-carpentry.org/conduct.html)

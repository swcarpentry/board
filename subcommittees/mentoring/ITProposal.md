# Suggestions to Instructor Training

**This is a rough draft.**

## Terminology

- [Checkout session](#checkout-session): 1h meeting where learners at
  Instructor Training deliver and review five-minute lessons

  The meetings are lead by Instructor Trainers and can have at maximum
  6 learners.
- Mini-lesson: 1h lesson for at least 3 people delivering part of one
  lesson from Software or Data Carpentry curriculum.
- Session: 3h lesson for at least 10 people delivering one full lesson
  from [Software][swc-lessons] or [Data Carpentry][dc-lessons] curriculum.
- Workshop: 12h lesson for at least 20 people delivering the full
  curriculum of [Software][swc-core] or Data Carpentry.
- Instructor in Training: can teach and organize a mini-lesson,
  session, or workshop under the supervision of a badged Software or
  Data Carpentry instructor.
- Instructor: can lead, teach, and organize a mini-lesson, session, or
  workshop.
- Program Coordinator: TODO (is this the Executive Director?)

## Badges

Anyone interested in joining the Software and/or Data Carpentry team
of instructors **must** complete the Instructor Training in any format
offered by Software and/or Data Carpentry.

Software and Data Carpentry will assign "Instructor in Training"
badges to people who have successfully completed a [checkout
session](#checkout-session).  After badging, Instructors in Training
have one year to teach one mini-lesson, one session, or one workshop
under the supervision of a badged Software or Data Carpentry
Instructor.  After each mini-lesson, session, or workshop, the
supervising Instructor **can** recommend the Instructor in Training
for the Instructor badge.  The Software and/or Data Carpentry
Executive Director will assign Instructor badges following the
recommendations of the supervising Instructor.  The Instructor in
Training badge expires after a year, by which time the Instructor in
Training should have become a badged Instructor.  If the Instructor in
Training has not become and Instructor and still wants to become one,
they must re-enter the Instructor Training process at the beginning.

## Checkout Session

1.  Watch a 5min lesson video of a Software or Data Carpentry instructor
    about one of the lessons on the currículum.

2.  Sign up for one checkout session.

3.  Join the checkout session.

4.  Deliver a 5min lesson about one of the lessons on the curriculum.

5.  Receive feedbacks about the lesson.

6.  Watch people at the checkout session.

7.  Provide feedback on the lessons delivered by others.

## Mentoring

Instructors in Training can wait for a invitation from the Program
Coordinator to join one workshop or can request the Mentoring
Subcommittee assistance to organize one mini-lesson, session, or
workshop.

### Invitation from the Program Coordinator

Timeframe: at least one month after invitation from the Program
Coordinator.  TODO: is this the timeframe from final-project →
invitation, or from invitation → workshop?

1. The Program Coordinator invites the Instructor in Training to
   co-teach at a workshop that already has an Instructor.

2. The supervising Instructor will help the Instructor in Training
   review the lesson s/he will deliver at the workshop.

3. The supervising Instructor and Instructor in Training **must** meet
   online 1 and 3 weeks before the workshop.

4. After the workshop, the supervising Instructor **may** recommend
   the Instructor in Training for the Instructor badge.

### Request Mentoring Subcommittee assistance

Timeframe: two-three months after the first meeting.

1. The Mentoring Subcommittee receives request to help and allocates
   the Instructor in Training to the next group, assigning a Mentoring
   Subcommittee member as supervisor.

2. The supervisor meets with the Instructor in Training to provide
   advices on contact hosts.

3. Two weeks later, the supervisor meets with the Instructor in
   Training to get updates and help setup the workshop page.

4. Two weeks later, the supervisor meets with the Instructor in
   Training to get updates and help review the lessons.

5. Two weeks later (and one week before the workshop), the supervisor
   meets with the Instructor in Training to get updates and help
   review the lessons.

4. After the workshop, the supervisor **may** recommend the Instructor
   in Training for the Instructor badge.

# Instructor Training Practicum Proposal

## Background and motivation

There are several reasons to offer a follow-up training experience to the base instructor training.
These reasons are: 

First, many freshly minted instructors have stated that once they are out of teacher training, they
still feel that they are not comfortable teaching our lessons. One of the things that can be done to
alleviate this is to ensure that they have worked through the lesson material that they will be 
teaching from, and also had experience in teaching from the material. Through this, we ensure that
they know the lesson material, and have helped and guided them through what they will be teaching.
It is likely that this will lower the threshold to teaching their first workshop.

Second, we are expecting that the people we admit to be our teachers already know certain things.
This might not be the case - we could have people who are great at Unix but who know little about
Git, and people with R knowledge who would not be able to manoeuvre on the command line. Thus, there
might be gaps in their knowledge, which the trainees themselves may or may not be aware of. By having
them work through the core lesson material, we ensure that the trainees have at least a minimum level
of knowledge in all of our core subjects. 

Third, many instructors don’t really know too many others within the Software and Data Carpentry
organizations. By having people working in teams during training, we strengthen between-instructor
connections which may lead to more discussions between instructors at a later stage. Also, by having
people already within the community mentoring future instructors, they get to know people already
inside of the organization. 

Fourth, as a bonus we get a lot of people working through the material, which can only be a benefit to
the lesson development process. It might draw more people into helping out with lesson development, and
could lower the bar for people developing new lessons.

With these goals in mind, we have developed a post-instructor training practicum.  

## Practicum elements

The instructor training practicum aims to facilitate the transition from the introductory instructor
training  to actually teaching workshops, by doing the following activities: 

### Mentoring

Future instructors, or trainees, form small groups and are assigned a mentor.  Over a period of a 3-4
weeks, they work through the core material for Software and Data Carpentry on their own, as if they
were workshop participants.  Each week, the group meets to discuss their experiences with the lesson
material and the mentor receives feedback and provides guidance.  The primary goal is not that the
trainees should be prepared enough to teach the module, but to become familiar with it and gain skills.  

### Mini-lessons

Each trainee chooses a topic relevant to Software or Data Carpentry (can be one of our lessons or
their own provided their mentor approves) and teaches a 1 hour lesson at their local institution to an
audience of their choice.  This lesson should be at least partially observed by a mentor and feedback
provided.  Whenever possible, the mentor observing the mini-lesson should be the mentor of the previous
mentoring element.  

### General comments

These two elements need not happen consecutively, but in the first implementation of this practicum
they will be consecutive, not parallel (see timeline).  

These two elements will be required to become a fully badged Software or Data Carpentry Instructor.  

## Implementation Logistics

### Mentoring Groups

For the first practicum, all recent participants in instructor training (online 8 week, December 2 day)
will be invited to join.  This program may be extended to include all newly trained instructors after
we have figured out how it works.

Candidates will sign up via a form that requests the following information: 

- Wants to teach Software Carpentry and/or Data Carpentry 
- Whether they want to do Python or R  
- group member preference from their training (if any) 
- time zone + geographic location (nearest airport), preferred time of day for meetings (daytime/evening) 
- Language preferences (if any). 
- When they went through instructor training 
 
### Mentors

An advertisement for mentors will be posted on the Software Carpentry blog, outlining the time
commitment, what is expected, and what will be provided: 

- Requirements: have taught at least 3 workshops, one of which must have been in this year.  
- Desired skills: An interest in helping people learn, strong communication skills.  Mentors need not
be experts in the lessons, although they should be somewhat familiar with lesson development and
history.  Expert help will be provided to support the mentors. 
- Time commitment: 1 hr of training (discussed below), 1 hr online / week for 3-4 weeks of mentoring,
2-3 hrs / week on email mentoring, ~2 hrs / group member on mini-lesson preparation, observation, and
follow-up.  Mentoring for this practicum is a time-limited focused committment; volunteering now
doesn’t mean you’re committing to doing it again 
- Training, discussion questions, and feedback tools will be provided 
- Mentors will be recognized as such on the Instructor webpage
- Mentors will be given certificates describing their involvement with teaching and training new instructors.
- Participation as a mentor will count towards the membership workshop count. 
  
Mentors can apply via a form that requests the following information: 

- SCF experience 
- Other teaching experience 
- R or Python preference 
- Time zone plus preferred time of day for meetings (daytime/evening) 

Before starting to meet with their groups, all mentors are required to attend the mentoring training
meeting. 

### Group formation


Based on data gathered on trainees and mentors regarding subject matter, time zone preferences and the like, the mentoring committee will form groups of 3-4 people (excluding the mentor). 


### Lead mentor

There will be a lead mentor who will lead the mentors in their work. That person will be in charge of
mentor training, and for keeping track of the progress of the groups by staying in touch with the
mentors. 

### Mentoring

Mentors will go through a one hour training meeting which will include an overview of responsibilities,
materials for facilitating discussions with their groups, methods of giving and receiving feedback, and
a review of the code of conduct.

It is the mentor’s responsibility to email their group members and set up a time to meet and an
expected lesson schedule (this can be over email or via an initial meeting).  

Each week, the group meets without the mentor to discuss their experience with the lesson.  The group
also meets with their mentor once a week for a more in-depth discussion.  Depending on the number of
groups and mentors, one mentor may be responsible for two groups.  We suggest that trainees meet on
Tues/Wed, with mentor on Friday or weekend, if convenient for the group. 

### Mini-lessons

The following is the proposed mini-lesson plan:  

1. Trainees will in collaboration with their mentor figure out a portion of material that the trainee
will teach from. The aim is to have approximately an hours worth of material. The trainee will then
prepare the material, including data, and make it available for review by the mentor. 
2. The mentor will then review the lesson plan and have a short (online) meeting with each trainee one
week before the trainee is scheduled to teach their Mini-lesson. Guidance on what to teach and how to
teach it will be given both via email and during face-to-face communication. 
3. The trainee teaches the 1 hr Mini-lesson, in person, to a minimum of 1 other individual while the
mentor observes either in person, or remotely. 
4. Directly after the Mini-lesson, the trainee and mentor engage in a debrief where the mentor first
asks the trainee to comment on their performance before they give feedback on the trainee’s performance. 
5. Within a week or two after the trainee has completed teaching their Mini-lesson, the mentor and
trainee will meet together for a debrief. The trainee will before this session fill out a short
questionnaire about how their lesson went, which will feed into the discussion with their mentor.
Questionnaire will be provided by the SCF. This debrief will preferably happen in groups, as the mentor
is likely to have several trainees that have taught the same material for their Mini-lessons. 
6. Trainees will be encouraged to make a suggested revision/edit/addition (e.g. new challenge question)
to the lesson topic they taught.  

## Timeline

Action items: 

- Create mentor “ad” blog post with clear expectations of how much time is involved, what training will
be provided, and what the mentor will need to do 
- develop form for creating groups 
- develop form for requesting mentors 
- discuss “mentor training” meeting with Greg 
- create a mechanism for people to report problems with their mentor or other group members (support
structures are important!)   
- write list of questions for each mentoring session, both for group sans mentor and mentor-led sessions 
- create feedback form or structure for mini-lesson feedback 
- create way for groups to offer feedback to their mentors and for the practicum as a whole

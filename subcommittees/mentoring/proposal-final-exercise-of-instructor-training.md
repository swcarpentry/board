# Checkout Session for Instructor Training

**This is a rough draft.**

## Terminology

-   Instructor Trainer: someone appointed by the Software Carpentry
    Steering Committee to lead a Instructor Training event.
-   Trainee: anyone that attended a Software Carpentry Instructor Training event.
-   [Pre-Checkout discussion session](#pre-checkout-discussion-session):
    meeting between a Instructor Trainer and some trainees
    to discuss one of Software or Data Carpentry lessons.
-   [Checkout session](#checkout-session): meeting between a Instructor Trainer
    and a trainee to conclude Instructor Training.

## Pre-Checkout Discussion Session

1.  Sign up for one pre-checkout discussion session
    that will cover the topic he/she want to cover at the checkout session.

2.  Join the pre-checkout discussion session.

## Checkout Session

**Before attend a checkout session all trainees are required
to join a pre-checkout discussion session.**

1.  Sign up for one checkout session.

2.  Join the checkout session.

3.  Deliver a 5min lesson about one of the lessons on the curriculum.

    The trainee decide which lesson he/she want to be checkout,
    but the Instructor Trainer leading the checkout session
    decides which segment of that lesson the trainee has to teach.

## After Checkout Session

The Instructor Trainer leading the checkout session decides
whether the trainee has passed, or should re-try at a later date.

Subject: Data & Software Carpentry Workshop Debriefing

Dear instructors,

If you are receiving this message, you have recently instructed at a Software or Data Carpentry workshop.

The Carpentries Mentoring Committee hosts instructor discussions every week in order to hear how workshops have gone, and we invite you to attend a discussion in the next few weeks to share about your recent workshop.  Even if you have attended a debriefing discussion before, we would appreciate feedback on any workshops you have done since then - we value hearing about your experiences. 

Upcoming discussions will occur on [Date 1], [Date 2] and [Date 3].  Each date has two time slots to accommodate time zones.  You can sign up for the most convenient time on this etherpad: 

    http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion

In addition to participating in the general discussion, we also welcome past instructors to co-host future discussions. Co-hosting a discussion session is a great way to share your expertise with both new and experienced instructors and is a lot of fun!  To co-host a future discussion, just sign up on the same etherpad above. 

We hope to see you soon!

Cheers,
[Your name]

Carpentries Mentoring Committee

# Procedure - Instructor Discussion Session

This document describes how instructor discussion sessions
are organized and conducted.  This information is summarized in 
checklists for the hosts and discussion organizer [here](checklists-discussion-sessions.md).  

## Terminology

-   **SCF**: Software Carpentry Foundation.

-   **DC**: Data Carpentry.

-   **Instructor discussion session**: an online meeting
    where instructors share experiences from teaching and
    obtain information while preparing to teach.

-   **Host**: member of the Mentoring Subcommittee
    who facilitates a discussion session.

## Motivation

1.  SCF and DC are community based projects
    and the community needs opportunity to interact.

2.  SCF and DC believe in jugyokenkyu, or "lesson study",
    and evidence-based education so instructors need opportunity to share experiences.

3. SCF and DC are continuing to increase the number of instructors
   and develop new lessons. New instructors would like to hear from 
   experienced teachers who have recently taught to help prepare for upcoming workshops.

## Before the meeting

The Mentoring Subcommittee is responsible for organizing
the instructor discussion sessions so that

-   each month has at least eight discussion sessions,

-   instructors are notified at least one week in advance and

-   each session has at least one host (preferably two) to conduct the discussion.

Meeting scheduling will be coordinated via [etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion).

The dates of instructor discussion sessions are also listed
in the SCF community calendar,
https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=oseuuoht0tvjbokgg3noh8c47g%40group.calendar.google.com.

Email invitations should be sent to three groups of instructors:

- instructors who have taught in the previous two weeks

- instructors who are preparing to teach in the next 4-6 weeks

- folks who have recently completed instructor training and need to
  attend a discussion session to complete their [checkout](http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training//11-checkout/)

The contact information for the first two groups is available in [AMY](https://amy.software-carpentry.org/workshops/). 
The chair of the mentoring subcommittee, as well as all members of the SCF Steering committee, 
should have access to AMY. Newly trained instructors should be directed to instructor discussion sessions 
following completion of instructor training.

## During the meeting

Meetings will be hosted via [etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion).

The agenda should be similar to the following:

- Welcome and host introduction
- Attendees introduction
    - Name, affiliation/position, purpose for attending
- Report from previous workshops
	- What main topics were taught (e.g. bash, python, git)?
    - What worked the best during your workshop?
    - What was the biggest hurdle?
    - Any changes or additions to lesson material?
- Preparing for upcoming workshops
    - Specific questions about teaching and/or lessons?
- Preparing for instructor training checkout
    - Questions about checkout procedure, lessons, or workshop organization?
    - Have you asked a question here yet?
- Reminder to discussion session participants: 
    - For big problems or concerns, start an issue on GitHub in the appropriate lesson or add to Google Doc of commonly mentioned concerns
    - For small typos, submit pull request to appropriate lesson
- Closing
	- What are you most excited about for teaching Software/Data Carpentry? 

Based on discussion among the mentoring committee, temporary questions may be 
added to the agenda for 
a month of sessions, in order to collect data on specific issues.  

Each instructor discussion session session must have at least one host
from the mentoring subcommittee (although two hosts are preferred). 

The **host** is responsible for: 

- hosting the meeting and facilitating discussion using the agenda described on the 
[etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion). 

- maintaining focus on the main goal of the session, which is to share ideas and keep instructors excited about teaching.

- ensuring instructors teaching in the near future have urgent questions or concerns addressed.

- collecting feedback from instructors who have recently taught.

- engaging newly trained instructors and evaluating their participating using a subset of 
questions described in the checkout procedure.

- encouraging attendees to create issues or pull requests to correct problems.


## After the meeting

The host of the meeting should report back to the lead instructor trainer and 
describe whether newly trained instructors participating as a part of the checkout procedure 
were engaged and could answer target questions described in the checkout procedure.

The host of the meeting should 1) archive the etherpad and 2) clean 
the etherpad for the next user. To archive, click the star in the top left 
corner. This will save a copy of the etherpad in its current state. Then, 
the faciliator should delete all the community added comments and change 
the dates to prepare the etherpad for the next session.  

The hosts of discussion sessions may choose to 
write a blog post summarizing topics discussed, including 
(but not limited to) the following: implementation of new lessons, 
recurring questions about or problems while teaching, and general strategies for 
instructing workshops. 
[This template](template-blog-about-debriefing-session.md) can be used
as the start point for the blog post.

# Checklists - Instructor Discussion Sessions

This document contains checklists for the people involved 
in instructor discussion sessions.  The full procedure is described 
on [this page](procedure-discussion-session.md).  

## For Hosts

Discussion sessions are organized and conducted through this etherpad: 

[http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion)

### In advance
- [ ] Sign up for a slot on the etherpad. 

### During
- [ ] Sign on and lead the meeting, following the agenda at the bottom of the 
etherpad.  
- [ ] If someone is attending as part of their training checkout, prompt them to 
ask questions.  
- [ ] Take notes, if possible, about meeting discussion

### After
- [ ] Archive the etherpad by clicking on the star in the top right corner.  
- [ ] Copy your notes to [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zQTkNCev9AzAlA464jUa8ifFaTx_8mb1NX6xvUbaGvM/edit) and label with the date and which session you led.  
- [ ] Email the instructor training coordinator (currently Greg Wilson) with the names 
of those participating as part of their training checkout.  (OR if you are an administrator 
in AMY and know how to enter information about trainees, enter their attendance directly, 
instead of emailing Greg.)  
- [ ] Clear the information from your session (date/time, attendees, notes) from the etherpad. 
- [ ] Optional: write a blog post about interesting points that came up in discussion; see 
[this template](template-blog-about-debriefing-session.md) as a starting point.

## For Discussion Session Organizer

This may apply to the Mentoring Chair, Software Carpentry administrator, or 
another volunteer.  

### Organizing meetings
- [ ] Recruit hosts for discussion sessions on a regular basis.  
- [ ] Every Monday, email instructors of workshops in the past week (Monday to 
Sunday), with the 
[post-workshop email](files/post_workshop_email.txt).  
- [ ] Every other Monday, email instructors teaching in the next 4 weeks (starting 
on Thursday of that week), with the [pre-workshop email](files/pre_workshop_email.txt)

### Follow up
- [ ] Facilitate discussion among hosts about the discussion sessions.  
- [ ] Ask for additional questions to be added temporarily to the agenda.
